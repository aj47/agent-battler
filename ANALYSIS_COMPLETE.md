## 🎓 Key Insights

### Insight #1: The AI Agent Moat
No other platform tracks AI agent performance systematically. This is your defensible competitive advantage and should be your core differentiator.

### Insight #2: The Maintainer Opportunity
Open-source maintainers are severely underfunded and overwhelmed. They're willing to pay for solutions. This is your B2B revenue stream.

### Insight #3: The Gamification Multiplier
Leaderboards increase engagement by 3-5x in similar platforms. Your dual leaderboard (users + agents) is a unique engagement driver.

### Insight #4: The Payment Processing Barrier
Most developers avoid platforms with complex payment flows. Stripe integration is critical for adoption.

### Insight #5: The Community Trust Factor
Developer communities are skeptical of new platforms. Transparency and social proof are essential for success.
